# 1. Basics of Relational Databases
## Engines and connection strings
```python
# Import create_engine
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create an engine that connects to the census.sqlite file: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///census.sqlite')

# Print table names
print(engine.table_names())
```

## Autoloading Tables from a database
```python
# Import create_engine, MetaData, and Table
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData, Table

# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///census.sqlite')

# Create a metadata object: metadata
metadata = MetaData()

# Reflect census table from the engine: census
census = Table('census', metadata, autoload=True, autoload_with=engine)

# Print census table metadata
print(repr(census))
```

## Viewing Table details
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData, Table

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///census.sqlite')

metadata = MetaData()

# Reflect the census table from the engine: census
census = Table('census', metadata, autoload=True, autoload_with=engine)

# Print the column names
print(census.columns.keys())

# Print full metadata of census
print(repr(metadata.tables['census']))
```

## Selecting data from a Table: raw SQL
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///census.sqlite')

# Create a connection on engine
connection = engine.connect()

# Build select statement for census table: stmt
stmt = 'SELECT * FROM census'

# Execute the statement and fetch the results: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Print results
print(results)
```

## Selecting data from a Table with SQLAlchemy
```python
# Import select
from sqlalchemy import select

# Reflect census table via engine: census
census = Table('census', metadata, autoload=True, autoload_with=engine)

# Build select statement for census table: stmt
stmt = select([census])

# Print the emitted statement to see the SQL string
print(stmt)

# Execute the statement on connection and fetch 10 records: result
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchmany(size=10)

# Execute the statement and print the results
print(results)
```

## Handling a ResultSet
```python
# Get the first row of the results by using an index: first_row
first_row = results[0]

# Print the first row of the results
print(first_row)

# Print the first column of the first row by accessing it by its index
print(first_row[0])

# Print the 'state' column of the first row by using its name
print(first_row['state'])
```

# 2. Applying Filtering, Ordering and Grouping to Queries
## Connecting to a PostgreSQL database
```python
# Import create_engine function
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create an engine to the census database
engine = create_engine('postgresql+psycopg2://student:datacamp@postgresql.csrrinzqubik.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/census')

# Use the .table_names() method on the engine to print the table names
print(engine.table_names())
```

## Filter data selected from a Table - Simple
```python
# Create a select query: stmt
stmt = select([census])

# Add a where clause to filter the results to only those for New York : stmt_filtered
stmt = stmt.where('state = "New York"')

# Execute the query to retrieve all the data returned: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Loop over the results and print the age, sex, and pop2000
for result in results:
    print(result.age, result.sex, result.pop2000)
```

## Filter data selected from a Table - Expressions
```python
# Define a list of states for which we want results
states = ['New York', 'California', 'Texas']

# Create a query for the census table: stmt
stmt = select([census])

# Append a where clause to match all the states in_ the list states
stmt = stmt.where(census.columns.state.in_(states))

# Loop over the ResultProxy and print the state and its population in 2000
for result in connection.execute(stmt):
    print(result.state, result.pop2000)
```

## Filter data selected from a Table - Advanced
```python
# Import and_
from sqlalchemy import and_

# Build a query for the census table: stmt
stmt = select([census])

# Append a where clause to select only non-male records from California using and_
stmt = stmt.where(
    # The state of California with a non-male sex
    and_(census.columns.state == 'California',
         census.columns.sex != 'M'
         )
)

# Loop over the ResultProxy printing the age and sex
for result in connection.execute(stmt):
    print(result.age, result.sex)
```

## Ordering by a single column
```python
# Build a query to select the state column: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.state])

# Order stmt by the state column
stmt = stmt.order_by(census.columns.state)

# Execute the query and store the results: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Print the first 10 results
print(results[:10])
```

## Ordering in descending order by a single column 
```python
# Import desc
from sqlalchemy import desc

# Build a query to select the state column: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.state])

# Order stmt by state in descending order: rev_stmt
rev_stmt = stmt.order_by(census.columns.state.desc())

# Execute the query and store the results: rev_results
rev_results = connection.execute(rev_stmt).fetchall()

# Print the first 10 rev_results
print(rev_results[:10])
```

## Ordering by multiple columns
```python
# Build a query to select state and age: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.state, census.columns.age])

# Append order by to ascend by state and descend by age
stmt = stmt.order_by(census.columns.state, census.columns.age.desc())

# Execute the statement and store all the records: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Print the first 20 results
print(results[:20])
```

## Counting distinct data
```python
# Build a query to count the distinct states values: stmt
stmt = select([func.count(census.columns.state.distinct())])

# Execute the query and store the scalar result: distinct_state_count
distinct_state_count = connection.execute(stmt).scalar()

# Print the distinct_state_count
print(distinct_state_count)
```

## Count of records by state
```python
# Import func
from sqlalchemy import func

# Build a query to select the state and count of ages by state: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.state, func.count(census.columns.age)])

# Group stmt by state
stmt = stmt.group_by(census.columns.state)

# Execute the statement and store all the records: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Print results
print(results)

# Print the keys/column names of the results returned
print(results[0].keys())
```

## Determining the population sum by state
```python
# Import func
from sqlalchemy import func

# Build an expression to calculate the sum of pop2008 labeled as population
pop2008_sum = func.sum(census.columns.pop2008).label('population')

# Build a query to select the state and sum of pop2008: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.state, pop2008_sum])

# Group stmt by state
stmt = stmt.group_by(census.columns.state)

# Execute the statement and store all the records: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Print results
print(results)

# Print the keys/column names of the results returned
print(results[0].keys())
```

## ResultsSets and pandas dataframes
```python
# import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame from the results: df
df = pd.DataFrame(results)

# Set column names
df.columns = results[0].keys()

# Print the Dataframe
print(df)
```

## From SQLAlchemy results to a plot
```python
# Import pyplot as plt from matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a DataFrame from the results: df
df = pd.DataFrame(results)

# Set Column names
df.columns = results[0].keys()

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)

# Plot the DataFrame
df.plot.bar()
plt.show()
```

```python

```
