# 1. Foundations of Containerization and Virtualization
## Limitations of physical machines
```
[x]Physical machines are costly.
[ ]Physical machines are not very customizable.
[x]Physical machines are complex to scale.
[x]Physical machines need maintenance.
```

## Defining virtual machine
```
[ ]A physical computer inside another physical computer.
[x]A simulated computer inside another computer.
[ ]A program that creates a visual representation of a computer screen within the display of another computer.
```

## Benefits of virtualization
```
True:
- VMs are platform-independent, and different operating systems can run seamlessly on the same host machine.
- Virtual machines offer greater scalability and flexibility than physical machines.
- Virtualization maximizes resource utilization, resulting in cost efficiencies and sustainable usage

False:
- Applications running in different virtual machines are less isolated than applications running on the same physical machine.
- Virtual machines typically cause more downtime than physical machines.
