# Chapter 1. Python Basics

# Chapter 2. Python List
## Create a list
```python
# area variables (in square meters)
hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50

# Create list areas
areas = [hall, kit, liv, bed, bath]

# Print areas
print(areas)
```

```python
# area variables (in square meters)
hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50

# Adapt list areas
areas = ["hallway", hall, "kitchen", kit, "living room", liv, "bedroom", bed, "bathroom", bath]

# Print areas
print(areas)
```

## Select the valid list
```python
# area variables (in square meters)
hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50

# house information as list of lists
house = [["hallway", hall],
         ["kitchen", kit],
         ["living room", liv],
         ["bedroom", bed],
         ["bathroom", bath]]

# Print out house
print(house)

# Print out the type of house
print(type(house))
```

## Subset and conquer
```python
# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Print out second element from areas
print(areas[1])

# Print out last element from areas
print(areas[-1])

# Print out the area of the living room
print(areas[5])
```

```python
# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Use slicing to create downstairs
downstairs = areas[0:6]

# Use slicing to create upstairs
upstairs = areas[6:10]

# Print out downstairs and upstairs
print(downstairs)
print(upstairs)
```

```python
# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Correct the bathroom area
areas[9] = 10.50

# Change "living room" to "chill zone"
areas[4] = "chill zone"
```

```python
# Create the areas list and make some changes
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "chill zone", 20.0,
         "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 10.50]

# Add poolhouse data to areas, new list is areas_1
areas_1 = areas + ["poolhouse", 24.5]

# Add garage data to areas_1, new list is areas_2
areas_2 = areas_1 + ["garage", 15.45]
```

```python
# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Create areas_copy
areas_copy = list(areas)

# Change areas_copy
areas_copy[0] = 5.0

# Print areas
print(areas)
```

```

# Chapter 4. Numpy
## Numpy
```python
# height is available as a regular list

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create a numpy array from height_in: np_height_in
np_height_in = np.array(height_in)

# Print out np_height_in
print(np_height_in)

# Convert np_height_in to m: np_height_m
np_height_m = np_height_in * 0.0254

# Print np_height_m
print(np_height_m)
```

```python
# height and weight are available as regular lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create array from height_in with metric units: np_height_m
np_height_m = np.array(height_in) * 0.0254

# Create array from weight_lb with metric units: np_weight_kg
np_weight_kg = np.array(weight_lb) * 0.453592

# Calculate the BMI: bmi
bmi = np_weight_kg / np_height_m**2

# Print out bmi
print(bmi)
```

## Boolean array indexing
```python
# height and weight are available as a regular lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Calculate the BMI: bmi
np_height_m = np.array(height_in) * 0.0254
np_weight_kg = np.array(weight_lb) * 0.453592
bmi = np_weight_kg / np_height_m ** 2

# Create the light array
light = bmi < 21

# Print out light
print(light)

# Print out BMIs of all baseball players whose BMI is below 21
print(bmi[light])
```

## ND Numpy Arrays
```python
# baseball is available as a regular list of lists

# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create a 2D numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the shape of np_baseball
print(np_baseball.shape)
```

```python
# baseball is available as a regular list of lists

# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create np_baseball (2 cols)
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the 50th row of np_baseball
print(np_baseball[49])

# Select the entire second column of np_baseball: np_weight_lb
np_weight_lb = np_baseball[:,1]

# Print out height of 124th player
print(np_baseball[123,0])
```

```python
# baseball is available as a regular list of lists
# updated is available as 2D numpy array

# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create np_baseball (3 cols)
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out addition of np_baseball and updated
print(np_baseball + updated)

# Create numpy array: conversion
conversion = np.array([0.0254, 0.453592, 1])

# Print out product of np_baseball and conversion
print(np_baseball * conversion)
```

med = np.median(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Median: " + str(med))

# Print out the standard deviation on height. Replace 'None'
stddev = np.std(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Standard Deviation: " + str(stddev))

# Print out correlation between first and second column. Replace 'None'
corr = np.corrcoef(np_baseball[:,0],np_baseball[:,1])
print("Correlation: " + str(corr))
```

```python
# heights and positions are available as lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Convert positions and heights to numpy arrays: np_positions, np_heights
np_positions = np.array(positions)
np_heights = np.array(heights)

# Heights of the goalkeepers: gk_heights
gk_heights = np_heights[np_positions == "GK"]

# Heights of the other players: other_heights
other_heights = np_heights[np_positions != "GK"]

# Print out the median height of goalkeepers. Replace 'None'
print("Median height of goalkeepers: " + str(np.median(gk_heights)))

# Print out the median height of other players. Replace 'None'
print("Median height of other players: " + str(np.median(other_heights)))
