# 1. Introduction to Modern Data Architecture
## What is a modern data architecture?
```
Which of the following is an appropriate definition of modern data architecture?

[ ]A secure, flexible, and scalable system for organizing and storing digital files.
[ ]A secure, flexible, and scalable system for real-time data processing and analysis.
[x]A secure, flexible, and scalable system for ingesting, managing, and analyzing large and diverse datasets.
```

## Modern vs traditional architectures
```
Modern data architecture;
- Self-service analytics tools
- Serverless architecture minimizing infrastructure management
- Auto-scaling capabilities to handle dynamic workloads
- Real-time processing

Traditional data architecture:
- Scheduled batch processing
- Data is primarily sourced from structured databases
- Heavy Reliance on In-House Infrastructure
```

## Lambda architecture
```
[ ]A traditional batch processing system that handles data in large, periodic batches.
[x]A processing approach for batch and streaming data independently that merges them to provide a unified view of data.
[ ]A processing approach that separates data into two paths: batch and real-time.
