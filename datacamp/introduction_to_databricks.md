# 1. Introduction to Databricks
## Why pick a Lakehouse?
```
Which of the following is not a reason to implement a lakehouse architecture?

[ ]You want great performance for both BI and machine learning workloads.
[ ]You want a single architecture to support all of your data workloads.
[x]You want to store all of your data in a proprietory data format.
[ ]You want the most cost-effective architectural solution for your organization.
```

## Benefits of the Databricks Lakehouse
As part of your presentation to the CIO, you would like to list why you should want to switch to the lakehouse architecture. Which of the following are key benefits of the Databricks platform? Select all that apply.
```
[x]Built on open-source technologies
[x]Databricks can run on any major cloud provider.
[x]Databricks enables data teams to be more collaborative.
[ ]Only teams that heavily use Python will benefit from Databricks
[ ]Database administrators can separate their data warehousing workloads away from other languages and personas.
```

## Architectural Decisions
```
## Data Warehouse
Typically very expensive
Performant for structured data only

## Data Lake
Data becomes very messy
Sub-optimal performance for different workloads

## Lakehouse
Great performance across all workloads
Very cost-effective for any data workload
```

## Why Delta?
```
The benefits of storing data in the Delta Lake table format include:

1. Fully ACID-compliant transactions: Delta Lake provides support for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, which ensures data integrity and consistency even in the face of concurrent data updates and failures.
2. Unified batch and streaming data sources: Delta Lake is designed to handle both batch and streaming data sources, making it suitable for real-time data processing scenarios.
3. Time travel and table history: Delta Lake allows you to access and query previous versions of the data (table history) through time travel capabilities, which can be useful for auditing, data recovery, and analysis purposes.

So, the correct answers are:

[x]Fully ACID-compliant transactions
[x]Unified batch and streaming data sources
[ ]Rigid table schema limitations
[x]Time travel and table history
```

## Databricks for different personas
```
One of the concerns of your CIO is that your future data architecture must satisfy all the different teams who work with your company's data. While you feel confident that Databricks can, you want to provide a list that clearly outlines supported personas.
Which of the following is not a dedicated persona in the Databricks Lakehouse platform?

[ ]Data engineer
[x]Software developer
[ ]Data scientist
[ ]SQL analyst
```

## Capabilities for each data persona
```
## SQL analyst
Dashboards
SQL Editor
SQL Warehouses

## Data Engineer
Delta Live Tables

## Data Scientist
Model Registry
Model Serving
```

## Managing and adding users
```
As your organization starts to adopt Databricks more, you have deployed multiple different workspaces for your lines of business. Each workspace is designed for a particular team and should only have access to their respective datasets. Your CIO has expressed concerns about how you can control access to the underlying datasets and the workspaces themselves as adoptions grow. They have asked you how Databricks and your architecture address this concern.
Which of the following statements is true with regard to user access within a Databricks account?

[ ]There is no way to easily ensure that users are assigned to the correct workspace, and must assign users manually.
[x]You can automatically sync users from your IdP to your Databricks account and then assign them to the correct workspaces based on their line of business.
[ ]You can automatically sync users from your IdP to your Databricks workspaces with no configuration
[ ]You do not need to assign users to Databricks, and can just pull their access information from your IdP.

Note: This means that while Databricks supports automatic synchronization of users from your Identity Provider, there is still a requirement for configuration or manual intervention to ensure that users are assigned to the correct workspaces according to their specific roles or lines of business. This approach helps maintain secure and organized access control as your organization scales up its use of Databricks.
```

## Control Plane vs. Data Plane
```
As you deploy your Databricks workspaces, you ensure your security team has approved the platform. In particular, the security team is curious about what information Databricks has access to and what you control.
Which of the following is true regarding the relationship between the Databricks Control Plane and the customer Data Plane?

[ ]The Control Plane stores customer data and the Databricks application, and the Data Plane only stores data.
[x]User interactions with the Databricks platform exist within the Control Plane, and is responsible for tasks such as launching clusters and initiating jobs.
[ ]Databricks creates a duplicate copy of everything between the Control and Data Plane.
[x]The Data Plane is where customers store their data in the data lake, ensuring better data security.
```

## Configure your Databricks workspace
```
Databricks:
Set up Unity Catalog to govern data.
Add users and groups to the Databricks environment.
Create a starter cluster and SQL Warehouse for your users.

Cloud Service Provider (CSP):
Collect and store data from source systems.
Set up user security groups across cloud services.

NOTE: Databricks focuses mainly on setting up data management and analytical environments, while CSP involves the collection, storage, and security management of data.
```



# 2. Data Engineering
## Data Explorer capabilities
```
You are a data engineer working for the centralized IT department at Sierra Publishing. On a day-to-day basis, you will get a variety of requests from different parts of your organization regarding different datasets. Historically, you have explored data programmatically by reading in different datasets one at a time.
Which of the following will be the benefits of using the Data Explorer instead of your previous approach?

[x]Ability to see sample data for a particular table.
[x]See the lineage for your data assets.
[ ]Provides the code to query a specific table.
[x]Ability to share data with other users.
[ ]Ability to automatically clean your data.
```

## Setting up a notebook
```
[ ]Create a SQL notebook and require all code to be in SQL.
[x]Create a Python notebook for your data engineering pipelines, and use %sql in the cells for your data analysts.
[ ]Create a Python notebook and require all code to be in Python.
[ ]There is no way for you to create a setup that supports both languages.

NOTE: This approach allows you to write in Python, which is your primary language, and enables your data analysts to write SQL queries within the same notebook by using the `%sql` magic command. Databricks notebooks support multi-language capabilities, making it possible to use different programming languages within the same notebook. This setup fosters collaboration and ensures that both you and your data analyst team can work efficiently in your preferred languages within the same data asset.
```

## Cluster configurations
```
## Valid Cluster Configuration
Databricks Runtime: Valid. The Databricks Runtime is a crucial part of the cluster configuration, encompassing the Apache Spark cluster manager and optimized versions of Hadoop components.
Node instance types: Valid. You can choose the types of nodes (instances) to use in your cluster. Different instance types offer varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity, suitable for different workloads.
Auto termination time: Valid. This setting allows clusters to automatically terminate after a specified period of inactivity, which is an important feature for cost savings.
User access to cluster: Partially Valid. While there isn't a direct setting to control user access to a cluster, managing user permissions and access controls at the workspace level indirectly relates to cluster usage.

## Invalid Cluster Configuration
How fast workloads run on the cluster: Invalid. There's no direct option to set the "speed" of workload execution. However, the performance of workloads is indirectly influenced by various settings like node types and cluster size.
Cluster monthly budget: Invalid. Databricks doesnâ€™t have a direct feature to set a "monthly budget" for clusters. However, cost management tools can be used to track and limit expenses, though this falls under organizational management rather than being a part of cluster configuration.
```

## Data Engineering foundations in Databricks
```
[x]DataFrames already exist in both pandas and SQL: This is correct. DataFrames are a common data structure used in both pandas (a popular Python library for data manipulation) and SQL. Your team's familiarity with these tools will be an advantage when working with DataFrames in Databricks.
[ ]DataFrames are complex and difficult to work with: DataFrames are a powerful and flexible way to work with data, but they are not inherently complex or difficult to work with. In fact, they provide a structured and efficient way to perform data operations, and their syntax is often more intuitive than writing raw SQL queries or using lower-level Spark RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets). Your team should not be discouraged by the perception that DataFrames are overly complex.
[x]Databricks will create the DataFrame, regardless of the language you use in your programming: This is also correct. Databricks supports multiple programming languages like Python, Scala, and R. DataFrames can be created and manipulated using these languages, so your team can continue using their preferred language while working with DataFrames.
[ ]DataFrames only work when writing code in Python
```

## DataFrames
```
[x] DataFrames already exist in both pandas and SQL: This is correct. DataFrames are a tabular data structure that exists in both pandas (a popular Python library for data manipulation) and SQL (Structured Query Language), so your team is likely already familiar with the concept of DataFrames.
[ ] DataFrames are complex and difficult to work with: This is not true. While DataFrames can handle complex data operations, they are designed to provide a convenient and intuitive way to work with structured data. They are not inherently difficult to work with, and with some training and practice, your team should be able to use them effectively.
[x] Databricks will create the DataFrame, regardless of the language you use in your programming: This is also correct. Databricks supports multiple programming languages, including Python, Scala, and R, for working with DataFrames. Regardless of the language your team chooses to use, Databricks will allow them to create and manipulate DataFrames.
[ ] DataFrames only work when writing code in Python: This is not true either. DataFrames can be used in multiple programming languages within the Databricks environment, as mentioned earlier. They are not limited to Python and can be used in Scala, R, and more.
```

## Reading from a database
```
Use spark.read() to use a JDBC connection and read data from the database.
```

## Write an external table
```
CREATE TABLE postgresql_table
USING postgresql
OPTIONS (
  dbtable '<table-name>',
  host '<database-host-url>',
  port '5432',
  database '<database-name>',
  user '<username>',
  password '<password>'
)
LOCATION <path-to-data-lake>
```

## Loading in hosted files
```
[x]Use Auto Loader to automatically ingest new data files as they come in: Auto Loader is a feature in Databricks that can automatically detect and ingest new data files as they are added to a specified directory. This would address the issue of not knowing when new data files come in and simplify the process of keeping your tables accurate by automatically incorporating new data.
[ ]Scheduling a job to check the directory every hour: this option is a manual approach and may not be as efficient or timely as using Auto Loader.
[ ]Creating a Kafka topic and continuously streaming the data: this option is a different approach that involves streaming data continuously and might be suitable for certain use cases, but it may not be necessary or the most straightforward solution for this specific problem.
```

## Selecting the right language
```
## Databricks Supported
Language: SQL - Joining two tables together
Language: R - Performing advanced statistical techniques on your data
Language: Python - Creating a custom function for a business-specific calculation

## Not Supported
Language: Rust - Creating a definition for a data schema
Language: C# - Crafting an In-depth testing process
Language: Ruby - Creating a complex function that Iterates over each row
```

## Data pipeline steps
```
1. Gather information about the Kafka topic: Before you can start processing the data, you need to gather information about the Kafka topic, such as the topic name, partitions, and offsets. This information will be essential for setting up the data stream.
2. Read the data into a Structured DataFrame: Once you have the necessary information about the Kafka topic, you can use Databricks to read the streaming data from Kafka into a Structured DataFrame. This step involves configuring the Kafka source and defining the schema for your DataFrame.
3. Clean the streaming data: After reading the data into a DataFrame, you may need to perform data cleaning and transformation operations. This could include handling missing values, data type conversions, or any other necessary data preparation tasks.
4. Join our other datasets into the stream: Next, you can join the streaming data with other datasets as required for your analytics. This step allows you to enrich the streaming data with additional context or information from your static datasets.
5. Write the stream as a Delta table in a new data lake bucket: Once you've processed and enriched the streaming data, you can write the result as a Delta table to a new data lake bucket. Delta tables in Databricks provide a reliable and efficient way to manage and version your data, making it available for downstream consumers.
```

## Possible automations in Databricks
```
## Can be a Databricks Job
- Python scripts: Databricks supports Python, and Python scripts can be executed as part of a Databricks Job.
- Databricks Notebooks: These are native to the Databricks environment and can be scheduled and automated as Databricks Jobs.
- SQL queries: Databricks supports the execution of SQL queries, which can be part of a Databricks Job.
- JAR files: Databricks can run JAR files as Jobs, especially those written for Apache Spark.
- dbt Tasks: Databricks can integrate with dbt (data build tool) for running transformation tasks as part of a Databricks Job.

## Cannot be a Databricks Job
- Cloud automations: This typically refers to broader cloud management tasks that are outside the scope of what Databricks Jobs are designed for.
- pgSQL scripts: While Databricks supports PostgreSQL syntax to some extent, running specific PostgreSQL (pgSQL) scripts directly as a Job might not be feasible without modifications or additional integrations.
- Excel macros: Databricks cannot execute Excel macros as they are specific to Microsoft Excel and require the Excel environment.
```

## Benefits of Delta Live Tables
```
[x]Combined process for batch and streaming datasets
[ ]Reduced need for data pipelines
[ ]Data is never lost or corrupted
[x]Maintain better data quality with set expectations
```

## Data pipeline steps
```
1. Ingest raw data files into a Delta table with Autoloader.
2. Create a Delta Live Table pipeline to clean and join datasets.
3. Create a Delta Live Table pipeline to aggregate datasets for BI applications.
4. Orchestrate all the Data Engineering tasks with a Databricks Workflow.
5. Monitor the data quality of the pipelines to keep track of the accuracy of your tables.
```




# 3. Databricks SQL and Data Warehousing
## Benefits of Databricks SQL
```
[x] Access to more advanced capabilities as part of a broader platform: Databricks provides a unified platform that integrates various advanced capabilities like machine learning, data engineering, and data science, in addition to its SQL capabilities. This integration can be highly beneficial for complex data analytics workflows.
[x] Flexible, open access to data and the SQL language: Databricks SQL offers flexible and open access to data, allowing users to query data across different data sources using the familiar SQL language. This flexibility can be crucial in a data-driven organization where data resides in various formats and locations.
[ ] Leverage a proprietary system that restricts access to different tools: This is not a benefit. In fact, this would be a limitation, as proprietary systems often restrict flexibility and integration with other tools and platforms.
[x] Use of a scalable, optimized compute engine for SQL workloads: Databricks SQL is built on a highly optimized and scalable compute engine designed to handle SQL workloads efficiently. This means that you can expect improved performance, especially for large-scale data processing tasks, which is a critical factor for analytics-driven organizations like yours.
```

## Databricks SQL in the data workflow
```
1. Ingest Raw Data into the Delta Lake: The first step is to ingest raw data into Delta Lake. Delta Lake provides a storage layer that brings reliability to Data Lakes. It allows you to store both structured and unstructured data and is an essential part of the Databricks platform.
2. Clean / Transform the Data with Delta Live Tables: Once the data is in Delta Lake, the next step is to clean and transform it. This step is crucial for ensuring data quality and usability. Delta Live Tables provide an easy and reliable way to transform and clean your data.
3. Aggregate the Data Based on Business Needs: After the data is cleaned and transformed, the next step is to aggregate it according to your business requirements. This involves summarizing your data to make it more suitable for analysis, such as calculating totals, averages, or other statistical measures.
4. Query the Data Using Databricks SQL: With your data aggregated, you can now query it using Databricks SQL. This SQL analytics service on Databricks allows you to run quick and efficient queries on your data, enabling you to extract meaningful insights.
5. Visualize Your Queries Using Your BI Tool: Finally, the insights gained from your queries can be visualized using a Business Intelligence (BI) tool. This step is about representing your data in a more accessible and understandable format, which is crucial for making informed business decisions.
```

## Databricks SQL vs. other databases
```
### Databricks SQL
- Operates on Open Data Formats: Databricks SQL is designed to work seamlessly with open data formats like Parquet, Delta Lake, etc. This is a distinguishing feature of Databricks SQL, as it allows for more flexibility and interoperability with different data sources and tools.
- Leverage ML Models: Databricks SQL integrates closely with machine learning capabilities, leveraging Apache Sparkâ€™s MLlib or Databricksâ€™ own machine learning features. This enables users to easily incorporate machine learning models into their SQL queries and analytics workflows.
- Built on ANSI SQL and Spark: Databricks SQL is built upon Apache Spark and supports ANSI SQL, which is a standard SQL dialect. This ensures compatibility with traditional SQL queries while also benefiting from Spark's distributed processing capabilities.

### Other Data Warehousing Tools
- Tech-Specific SQL: Traditional data warehousing tools often use proprietary or tech-specific SQL dialects. This might limit interoperability and could require more specialized knowledge compared to the more universally known ANSI SQL.
- SQL Workloads Only: Many conventional data warehousing solutions are primarily designed for SQL workloads and might not natively support machine learning or operations on open data formats. They focus more on structured data processing and analysis.
```

## Choosing your SQL warehouse
```
[ ]Pro: Typically offers more advanced features and customization options. However, it might not be as quick to spin up compared to a serverless option, which can be a drawback for users who need immediate access to data.
[x]Serverless: This type of warehouse is designed for ease of use and quick accessibility. It generally requires less management and can automatically scale to meet demand, meaning users won't have to wait for the warehouse to spin up. This aligns well with the users' expectation of quickly accessing data. Additionally, Databricks has been known to integrate the latest features into their serverless offerings.
[ ]Classic: Usually the most basic option with standard features. It might not include the latest updates from Databricks as promptly as the serverless option and could have longer spin-up times compared to serverless warehouses.
```

## SQL Editor vs. notebooks
```
[X]A dedicated data explorer pane to see catalogs, schema, and tables - This feature can be a significant benefit of the SQL Editor. A dedicated data explorer pane provides an easy and organized way to view and manage databases, schemas, and tables, which is essential for efficient SQL query writing and data exploration.
[X]Dedicated area for writing SQL queries - The SQL Editor typically offers a streamlined and specialized interface for writing SQL queries. This focused environment can enhance productivity and user experience, especially for those primarily working with SQL.
[ ]SQL queries always run faster in the SQL Editor - This statement is misleading. The speed of SQL query execution depends on various factors such as the query's complexity, the amount of data being processed, and the underlying database's performance. The interface used for writing the query (SQL Editor vs. Notebook) does not inherently affect the execution speed.
[ ]Databricks will write SQL queries for you in the SQL Editor - This is not a feature of the SQL Editor. While some tools may offer query suggestions or autocomplete features, the actual writing of SQL queries is still a manual process that requires user input and decision-making.
