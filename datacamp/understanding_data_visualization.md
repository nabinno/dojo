# 1. Visualizing distributions
## Continuous vs. categorical variables
```
continuous
- Salary of employees
- Mass of squirrels
- Percentage of questions answered correctly
- Population of towns in Canada


categorical
- Provinces of towns in Canada
- Species of squirrels
- Was the exam passed or failed?
- Job title of employees
```

## Interpreting histograms
```
0True
- The histogram is unimodal.
- The histogram is right-skewed.
- The histogram is bimodal.

False
- The most popular salary bracket is $560k to $580k.
- The histogram is left-skewed.
- The most popular salary bracket is $40k to $60k.
```

## Adjusting bin width
```
[ ]The agouti had a high level of activity from 4am to 12pm, then moderate activity from 12pm to 8pm.
[x]The agouti were most active for a couple of hours after sunrise (6:30am to 8:30am), and before sunset (4pm to 6m).
[ ]The agouti showed a constant level of activity throughout sunlight hours.
[ ]The agouti activity was highly variable, with over a dozen peaks in activity throughout the day

## Interpreting box plots
```
True
- In 1990, three states were considered to have extreme values in the number of packets of cigarettes smoked per capita.
- The inter-quartile range of the number of packets of cigarettes smoked per capita decreased every year from 1985 to 1995.
- The median number of packets of cigarettes smoked per capita was below 100 from 1991 onwards.

False
- The lower quartile number of packets of cigarettes smoked per capita decreased every year from 1985 to 1995.
- The upper quartile number of packets of cigarettes smoked per capita decreased every year from 1985 to 1995.
- The inter-quartile range of the number of packets of cigarettes smoked per capita was smallest in 1992.

# 2. Visualizing two variables
## Interpreting scatter plots
```
True
- There is a positive correlation between the life expectancy and the length of schooling.
- Exactly one country averages more than 14 years schooling.
- As the average length of schooling increases, the average life expectancy typically increases too.
- Every country with an average life expectancy of less than 60 years has an average length of schooling less than 7 years.

False
- There is a negative correlation between the life expectancy and the length of schooling.
- No countries have an average length of schooling less than 6 years and an average life expectancy of more than 75 years.
- No countries have an average life expectancy of less than 55 years.
- If one country has a longer average length of schooling than another country, that country will also have a greater average life expectancy.
```

## Interpreting line plots
```
True
- In 1930, adoption of automobiles was greater than 50%.
- In 1945, two out of the four technologies had lower adoption than in 1940.
- After 1940, adoption of refrigerators was always higher than adoption of stoves.

False
- It took longer for refrigerators to go from 50% adoption to 75% adoption than it took vacuums.
- In 1940, adoption of stoves was greater than adoption of automobiles.
- After 1940, adoption of automobiles was always higher than adoption of vacuums.
```

## Logarithmic scales for line plots
```
[ ]On Feb 3, excluding mainland China, US had the most cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19.
[x]On Feb 17, Germany had more cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 than France.
[ ]On Mar 02, Iran had less than 1000 cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19.
[ ]On Mar 16, US had less than 4000 cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19.
