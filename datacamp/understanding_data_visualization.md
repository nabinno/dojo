# 1. Visualizing distributions
## Continuous vs. categorical variables
```
continuous
- Salary of employees
- Mass of squirrels
- Percentage of questions answered correctly
- Population of towns in Canada


categorical
- Provinces of towns in Canada
- Species of squirrels
- Was the exam passed or failed?
- Job title of employees
```

## Interpreting histograms
```
0True
- The histogram is unimodal.
- The histogram is right-skewed.
- The histogram is bimodal.

False
- The most popular salary bracket is $560k to $580k.
- The histogram is left-skewed.
- The most popular salary bracket is $40k to $60k.
```

## Adjusting bin width
```
[ ]The agouti had a high level of activity from 4am to 12pm, then moderate activity from 12pm to 8pm.
[x]The agouti were most active for a couple of hours after sunrise (6:30am to 8:30am), and before sunset (4pm to 6m).
[ ]The agouti showed a constant level of activity throughout sunlight hours.
[ ]The agouti activity was highly variable, with over a dozen peaks in activity throughout the day
