# 1 Methods for Processing Data
## Batch ordering
```
Batch Process:
- Is run to completion
- Has a known size
- Runs on an interval

Other:
- Always listens for new data
- Runs forever
```

## On the scale
```
Vertical scaling:
- Faster CPU
- Faster memory
- Better networking

Horizontal scaling:
- More SSDs (Solid State Drive)
- More computers
- More CPUs
```

## Horizontally opposed
