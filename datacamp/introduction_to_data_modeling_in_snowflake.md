# 1 Fundamentals of Data Modeling
## Components of data modeling
```
Entity:
- Data about an object, concept, or place

Attribute:
- They help distinguish one entity from another
- Property or characteristic

Relationship:
- Describes how two or more things one connected
- Shows the association between multiple entities
```

DESC TABLE ecommerceonlineretail;
