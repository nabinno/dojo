# 1 Introduction to DevOps
## Use Cases for DevOps
```
True:
- DevOps helps organize engineering organizations in an improved way.
- DevOps uses MVPs to increase the pace of innovation.

False:
- Traditional change management models suggest an MVP release and product improvements.
- DevOps aims to go to the market with a finished product.
```

## Which engineer?
```
Infra Engineering:
- You want your engineers to setup an access management policy that ensure only the authorized personnel can access your databases
- You want to use a cloud solution for your website and you need engineers to do the configuration

Product Engineering:
- You want to add functionality to your website that allows people to book their hotels directly from your website
- You want to integrate a car rental agency's webpage to allow users to book car rentals through your website

Data & ML Engineering:
- You want to create intelligent systems to provide suggestions to your customers using their post behaviour
- You want to capture user data on your website and record that into a database in real-time
```

## Employing the correct model
```
1. DevOps
2. DataOps
3. MLOps
```

## DevOps implementations
```
Your engineering organization is growing, and now you have Data Engineers, Machine Learning Engineers, and Software Developers. You want all of the teams to work closely and collaboratively. Also, you want your teams to use the MVP approach (building the basic functionality first, adding functionality later). Which of the below methodologies should you employ?

[ ]DataOps
[ ]MLOps
[ ]DevOps
[x]All three: DataOps, MLOps, and DevOps
```

## Project management frameworks
```
True:
- Waterfall could be a viable option for small tasks that does not have much complexity
- Kanban is all about continuous improvement and using visualizations
- Scrum and Kanban are both great implementations of the Agile philosophy

False:
- Scrum does not define specific roles but ensures collective responsibility
- Agile is a definitive project management methodology with set practices
```

## Factors to decide the best project management framework
```
Important Factors:
- The size of the team
- The budget of the project
- The complexity of the project

Unimportant / Irrelevant Factors:
- Using cloud infrastructure
- The age of the organization
```

## Choosing the best project management model
```
You have decided to use DevOps for developing the minimum viable product (MVP) for the proposed new feature, it is time to choose the best project management framework for this. The product expert in your team suggests using a mind-mapping tool to visualize the tasks and ensure collaboration within your team. You agree with his suggestion. Which project management framework below could be the most suited for this purpose?

[ ]Waterfall
[ ]Agile
[x]Scrum
[ ]Kanban

# 2 DevOps Architecture
## DevOps cycle components
```
Defining the deliverables and goals related to the product, the software components, their functionality and relation to each other
Writing the code for the software components of the product
Check if the product functions as planned
Release the product for a limited set of users
Review the product one last time before the launch
Release the product for all of the users
```

## Data Engineering in the DevOps cycle
```
Design:
- Working with the product engineering teams to plan how data should flow between systems

Development:
- Implement the data pipelines that allows the data flow between systems

Testing:
- Provide mock data to the product to see if it behaves as planned
