# 1 Introduction to DevOps
## Use Cases for DevOps
```
True:
- DevOps helps organize engineering organizations in an improved way.
- DevOps uses MVPs to increase the pace of innovation.

False:
- Traditional change management models suggest an MVP release and product improvements.
- DevOps aims to go to the market with a finished product.
```

## Which engineer?
```
Infra Engineering:
- You want your engineers to setup an access management policy that ensure only the authorized personnel can access your databases
- You want to use a cloud solution for your website and you need engineers to do the configuration

Product Engineering:
- You want to add functionality to your website that allows people to book their hotels directly from your website
- You want to integrate a car rental agency's webpage to allow users to book car rentals through your website

Data & ML Engineering:
- You want to create intelligent systems to provide suggestions to your customers using their post behaviour
- You want to capture user data on your website and record that into a database in real-time
```

## Employing the correct model
```
1. DevOps
2. DataOps
3. MLOps
```

## DevOps implementations
```
Your engineering organization is growing, and now you have Data Engineers, Machine Learning Engineers, and Software Developers. You want all of the teams to work closely and collaboratively. Also, you want your teams to use the MVP approach (building the basic functionality first, adding functionality later). Which of the below methodologies should you employ?
