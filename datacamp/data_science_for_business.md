# 1. Introduction to Data Science
## Customer Segmentation Workflow
```
1. Use SQL to download the delivery date of each box
2. Create a line chart that shows decay in subscriptions by cohort
3. Cluster the users into different personas and perform a regression to predict churn for each cluster

NOTE: This order allows the team to first gather the necessary data, then visualize the subscription decay, and finally, perform customer segmentation and regression analysis to understand and predict churn.
```

## Building a customer service chatbot
```
Data Collection:
- Gather corresponding customer information for each conversation
- Input the timestamps for each transcript

Exploration and Visualization:
- Create a bar chart of the number of conversations of each type
- Plot the number of conversations vs. the time of day

Experimentation and Prediction:
- Use a Markov model to predict possible responses for each question
- Create an algorithm that classifies the initial customer question
```

## Improving OKRs
```
[x]Use a linear regression to estimate a user's Net Promoter Score (NPS) based on their previous purchases, social media interactions, and cohort.
[ ]Collect data on which users are most active on the website.
[ ]Create a dashboard with a histogram showing the number of users with different levels of engagement.

NOTE: This Key Result involves applying predictive modeling techniques (linear regression) to estimate NPS based on various user data, which aligns with the concept of predicting outcomes using data. It also involves experimentation by building a predictive model to assess user behavior.

## Assigning data science projects
```
## Traditional Machine Learning
- Cluster customers into different segments
- Dynamic pricing of products

## Internet of Things
- Automate building cooling using temperature sensors
- Detect machinery failure with vibration detectors

## Deep Learning
- Automatically summarize text from meeting notes
- Flag images that contain a safety violation
```

## Building a data science team
```
[ ]1. Traditional machine learning: Traditional machine learning techniques involve training models on structured data to make predictions or classifications. In the case of the startup, while they may use some machine learning algorithms to process the sensor data and make predictions about traffic conditions, the primary focus appears to be on sensor technology and data collection rather than machine learning. Therefore, this category may not be the best fit.
[ ]2. Deep learning: Deep learning involves using neural networks to analyze and extract patterns from data. If the startup is using deep learning models to process the sensor data and provide traffic insights, then this category could be relevant. However, based on the provided information, it seems that the startup's core innovation is the sensor technology itself, with data collection being a key component. Deep learning might come into play for more advanced analysis, but it's not the primary focus.
[x]3. Internet of things (IoT): IoT refers to the network of interconnected physical devices that collect and exchange data. In this case, the startup's product involves installing vibration sensors to collect data from bridges and highways. This aligns closely with the IoT concept, as it involves sensor deployment, data collection, and potentially remote monitoring. Therefore, categorizing the startup under the IoT category would be appropriate.
[ ]4. Natural language processing (NLP): NLP deals with the interaction between computers and human language. Given that the startup's focus is on vibration sensors and traffic measurement, it does not seem relevant to the NLP category, as it doesn't involve language processing or text analysis.
