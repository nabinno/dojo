# 1. Introduction to Data Science
## Customer Segmentation Workflow
```
1. Use SQL to download the delivery date of each box
2. Create a line chart that shows decay in subscriptions by cohort
3. Cluster the users into different personas and perform a regression to predict churn for each cluster

NOTE: This order allows the team to first gather the necessary data, then visualize the subscription decay, and finally, perform customer segmentation and regression analysis to understand and predict churn.
```

## Building a customer service chatbot
```
Data Collection:
- Gather corresponding customer information for each conversation
- Input the timestamps for each transcript

Exploration and Visualization:
- Create a bar chart of the number of conversations of each type
- Plot the number of conversations vs. the time of day

Experimentation and Prediction:
- Use a Markov model to predict possible responses for each question
- Create an algorithm that classifies the initial customer question
```

## Improving OKRs
```
[x]Use a linear regression to estimate a user's Net Promoter Score (NPS) based on their previous purchases, social media interactions, and cohort.
[ ]Collect data on which users are most active on the website.
[ ]Create a dashboard with a histogram showing the number of users with different levels of engagement.

NOTE: This Key Result involves applying predictive modeling techniques (linear regression) to estimate NPS based on various user data, which aligns with the concept of predicting outcomes using data. It also involves experimentation by building a predictive model to assess user behavior.
