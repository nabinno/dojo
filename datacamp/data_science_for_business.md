# 1. Introduction to Data Science
## Customer Segmentation Workflow
```
1. Use SQL to download the delivery date of each box
2. Create a line chart that shows decay in subscriptions by cohort
3. Cluster the users into different personas and perform a regression to predict churn for each cluster

NOTE: This order allows the team to first gather the necessary data, then visualize the subscription decay, and finally, perform customer segmentation and regression analysis to understand and predict churn.
```

## Building a customer service chatbot
```
Data Collection:
- Gather corresponding customer information for each conversation
- Input the timestamps for each transcript

Exploration and Visualization:
- Create a bar chart of the number of conversations of each type
- Plot the number of conversations vs. the time of day

Experimentation and Prediction:
- Use a Markov model to predict possible responses for each question
- Create an algorithm that classifies the initial customer question
