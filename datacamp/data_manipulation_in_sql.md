# 1 We'll take the CASE
## Basic CASE statements
```
-- Identify the home team as Bayern Munich, Schalke 04, or neither
SELECT
    CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 10189 THEN 'FC Schalke 04'
        WHEN hometeam_id = 9823 THEN 'FC Bayern Munich'
         ELSE 'Other' END AS home_team,
    COUNT(id) AS total_matches
FROM matches_germany
GROUP BY home_team;
```

## CASE statements comparing column values
```
SELECT
    date,
    -- Identify home wins, losses, or ties
    CASE WHEN home_goal > away_goal THEN 'Home win!'
        WHEN home_goal < away_goal THEN 'Home loss :('
        ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
FROM matches_spain;
```
