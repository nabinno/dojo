# 1. Data Warehouse Basics
## Knowing the what and why
```
In the last video, we discussed what is a data warehouse, what it does, and why it is valuable to the organization.

[ ]A data warehouse cannot integrate data from different areas of an organization but must gather data from only one area
[x]Data warehouses enable organizational analysis and decision-making
[ ]A data warehouse is not used for analysis but primarily to store and back up data from other critical systems
[ ]Data warehouses are designed only to store the AI models of a data scientist or analyst
